## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of the **Data Analysis Bootcamp (Fall 1403)** and focuses on analyzing **NBA player and team data**. The project consists of three main phases:

1. **Data Collection (Web Scraping)** – Extracting data from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com) using **Selenium**.
2. **Database Design & Storage** – Storing the extracted data in a relational database using **SQLAlchemy**.
3. **Data Analysis & Visualization** – Performing statistical analysis and hypothesis testing to derive key insights about player and team performance.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Selenium** (Web Scraping)
- **SQLAlchemy** (Database Management)
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data Manipulation)
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (Data Visualization)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Development & Analysis)

## 🔍 Project Phases

### 📂 Phase 1: Data Extraction (Web Scraping)
Utilized **Selenium** to extract NBA data and structured it into six well-defined tables:

1. **Players** – Includes player details such as name, birthdate, nationality, height, weight, position, and career timeline.
2. **Teams** – Stores team names, founding years, championship records, and performance statistics.
3. **Seasons** – Contains season records, including the championship-winning team for each year.
4. **Season Players** – Tracks player performance metrics per season, including points scored and team affiliation.
5. **Awards** – Lists various NBA awards along with their historical winners.
6. **Player Trophy** – Links players with their awards in each season, ranking their achievements.

### 🏛 Phase 2: Database Design & Storage
Designed and implemented a **relational database** using **SQLAlchemy** and **MySQL**. Key database features:
- **Tables:** Players, Teams, Seasons, Season Players, Awards, Player Trophy.
- **Relationships:** Established foreign keys to efficiently connect players, teams, and awards data.
- **Normalization:** Optimized data redundancy and improved query performance.

### 📊 Phase 3: Data Analysis & Hypothesis Testing
Performed various **statistical analyses** to uncover insights, including:
- **Distribution trends** of player height and experience over seasons.
- **Impact of player positions** on team success.
- **Identifying top players** for recruitment based on historical performance.
- **Hypothesis testing** on agility trends and player development.
